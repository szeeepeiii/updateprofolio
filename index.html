        <p class="p1">I am always who I am and I never try to be anybody else. So let me introduce myself here to you . Me name is Kristen. I am from china and I came to America when I was 11, first I landed at Atlanta, Georgia then I decided to move to New York half a year ago. I go to baruch college in manhattan planning to major in finance.  <br> 
            <p class="p2">New York  was definitely a different experience for me. New York is not a just a state to me, it is a new world to me compared to Georgia. The crowd-ness , the diversity, and uniqueness among every New Yorker excites me. There are definitely a lot to learn in the big new world.</p>
            <p class="p3">Despite the new excitement in the big city, I really missed my mom and her cookings. It is very comforting to have someone to prepare your foods everytime.And I am very thankful for that. I clearly remenber her giving me little lessons before I came to New york. She specifically told me to think through and make the right decision because now I am alone in NY and no one will be there to look after me. Coming to New York was not an easy thing. I have to work to support my own life because I want my mom to believe that I can be indepedent without her. </p>
